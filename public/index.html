			<h1>How They Work</h1>
			<p>Hand Shrinkers work in a very simple way. They constrict your hands so much, they actually shrink! Just slide the gloves on, and touch the <strong>Shrink!</strong> button on the back and watch as the Hand Shrinkers constrict your hands to a reasonable size. No one will ever tell you that your hands look fat again!</p>
